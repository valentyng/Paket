# Analyzers

[Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) the new open source compiler for C# and Visual Basic introduced the
possibility to add new warnings and errors to the build via **Analyzers**.

Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio Code present them visually and also allow **Code Fixes**: Automated
actions to fix a specific warning or error.

While analyzers can be installed from the Visual Studio extension gallery, for them to be used in command line
builds and shared by all developers they must be installed as NuGet packages for each project.

Each package can either contain only analyzers or analyzers along with other files, allowing a library to include
automated migration from now-Obsolete constructs or warnings on incorrect usage. 

## Referencing analyzers


When a NuGet package containing analyzers is added to a [`paket.references`](references-files.html)
file, the analyzers will be installed in the corresponding projects automatically by Paket.

*Analyzers are only supported by roslyn based compilers, in other versions the nodes added by Paket will be ignored.*

## Conventions for NuGet packages

Analyzers created by the "Analyzer with Code Fix" template are currently installed via `Install.ps1` in Visual Studio
that Paket doesn't plan support (See the [FAQ](faq.html#paket-vs-powershell-install-scripts) for more details)

For them to work in Paket they need to be placed in specific folders inside the NuGet package.

The structure look like :

```none
|- analyzers
|  |- dotnet
|  |  |- cs
|  |  |  |- My.CSharpAnalyzer.dll
|  |  |- vb
|  |  |  |- My.VisualBasicAnalyzer.dll
|  |  |- My.SharedAnalyzer.dll
```

The general structure is :

/analyzers/dotnet/*language*/*my_analyzer*.dll

This structure is already the one generated by the "Analyzer with Code Fix" template and conform to the
[proposed convention](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetDocs/pull/362) for analyzers to be installed by NuGet
in `project.json` based projects.

If the language is absent from the path the analyzer will be installed in any supported project type
(`.csproj`, `.vbproj` and `.fsproj`) if it is present the analyzer will only be installed in the corresponding
project type :

* `cs` -> `.csproj`
* `vb` -> `.vbproj`
* `fs` -> `.fsproj` 

**Remarks:**

- There is currently no way to create analyzers for F#.
- The `dotnet` part of the path is in fact the host platform that is targeted. The only one currently in existence
  is the roslyn compiler and it require the `dotnet` framework.
- The roslyn developers maintains some analyzers under the
  [roslyn-analyzers](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers) project but others have started to appear
  like [Refactoring Essentials](http://vsrefactoringessentials.com/) or
  [Code Cracker](https://code-cracker.github.io/).
